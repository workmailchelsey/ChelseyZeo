What is this?
==

Do you record your sleep phases with [zeo mobile](http://www.myzeo.com/sleep/shop/featured-products/zeo-sleep-manager-mobile-pro.html)?
If you're having naps or doing [polyphasic sleep](http://six40winks.com/about/) 
then you probably only get to see the core-sleep on the website, but are missing all the nap data. 
The code in this repository can help you rescue all the sleep data from your android phone.
This has the code necessary to build an android app (at least under Ubuntu 12.04 where it was tested, 
but it should be quite universal)

Disclaimers!!
==

This app has been developed independently of [zeo-eng](https://github.com/zeoeng) or the ZEO Inc. company.	
This code was built upon [zeo-android-api](https://github.com/zeoeng/zeo-android-api)
but **Zeo is in no way related to this particular code**, responsible for any error, omission or problem with it.

So be warned: This code may eat your phone and spit a pile of rubble.  There. You've been warned.
